1) What do you think we were trying to get you to learn with this challenge?
  Working with hashes, interacting across classes.

2) Outline in words (at least 5-6 sentences) what your code is doing in order to
solve this problem.

  I created instance variables for type, participants and total cost so that the
  information inside them can be dynamic.  I then confirmed this in my test file
  by passing in different arguments to the cost value in the add participant
  array as well as adding and subtracting participants.

3) What was the most difficult portion of this for you?
  Figuring out how to split the cost of an activity between participants.

4) What came naturally to you?
  Setting up the initialize method, attr_reader, and tests for attributes.
